This project demonstrates a complete end-to-end Machine Learning workflow, starting from data loading and preprocessing to model training, evaluation, and predictions.
It is designed to help beginners and intermediate learners understand how ML works in real-world scenarios using a structured and practical example.

This project uses the dataset excalories.csv, which contains calorie-related data used to train a prediction model.

✨ Features

🔹 Clean and structured Jupyter Notebook (main.ipynb)

🔹 Data preprocessing and exploratory analysis

🔹 Machine Learning model training & evaluation

🔹 Visualizations for better understanding

🔹 A fully reproducible workflow

🧠 Why This Project Is Special

This project shows you:

How real ML pipelines are built.

How to clean, transform, and visualize data.

How ML models learn from patterns using math and probability.

How to make accurate predictions using trained models.

A foundation that can be scaled into AI/ML applications used in fitness apps, health monitoring systems, or nutrition analysis tools.

It is not just a simple project — it teaches you industry-level steps used by Data Scientists.
